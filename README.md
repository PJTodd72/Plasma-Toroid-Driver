# Plasma-Toroid-Driver

Version one of the Ki-Cad schematics and PCB layout of the Plasma Toroid generator driver circuits.

Also included are the Gerber files and interactive BOM generated by Ki-Cad.

Included is a simulation in LT spice of the driver circuit with no load.
This circuit oscillates as expected, however a simulation of the plasma load needs to be added for completion.
